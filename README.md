This is a basic searching algorithms visualizer I made using a canvas in Javascript. The idea was taken from gray utopia's 2-part Youtube tutorial (part 1- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIMmMS_G6-I) from where much of the code behind setting up the grid and maintaining the states of its cells has been taken. However, I implemented an animated representation by calling the solver methods using Javascript intervals. I also implemented the Dijkstra's algorithm and the A* searching algorithm along with the BFS algorithm which was originally implemented in the tutorial.
